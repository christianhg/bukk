# bukk

> A functional library for Norwegians.

## Why?

Just kidding. Inspired by [ramda](https://github.com/ramda/ramda), this an automatically curried, data-last, functional JavaScript library.

## How is this better than ramda?

It's not. It exists mainly for the purpose of letting its author get more experienced with functional programming.

## "Bukk?"

"Bukk" means "ram" in Norwegian.
